For a complete PWA, you'll need to create app icons in the following sizes:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

You should create these icons based on your app logo/branding.
Use a tool like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or online services like:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/

These icons should be placed in the /public/icons/ directory.

For the Google Play Store specifically, you'll also need:
1. A 512x512 app icon
2. A feature graphic (1024x500)
3. Screenshots in various sizes (typically 16:9 ratio)
4. A privacy policy page

Once you have your icons, replace the placeholder icons and update the SHA256 fingerprint in the assetlinks.json file with the one generated during your Google Play Store app creation process.
