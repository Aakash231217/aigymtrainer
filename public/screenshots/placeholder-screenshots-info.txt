For your PWA to appear correctly on Google Play Store, you'll need to provide high-quality screenshots:

1. Phone Screenshots (recommended sizes):
   - 1080 x 1920 pixels (portrait)
   - At least 3-8 screenshots showing key features

2. Tablet Screenshots (if applicable):
   - 1080 x 1920 pixels or 1920 x 1080 pixels (7-10 inch tablets)
   - At least 3-8 screenshots showing key features

These screenshots should highlight the main features of your Athonix app:
- Home page/dashboard
- Workout creation interface
- AI assistant interaction
- Exercise tracking
- User profile/stats
- Group features
- Any other standout features

Place these screenshots in the /public/screenshots/ directory and reference them in your manifest.json file.
